Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
In WordPress, add RSS-links into WordPress Links and then add them to a link category name.
Choose your settings in the Hypernews settings page.
Category name is the exact match to your link category name. 
Intervall is not used right now, coming soon.
Max Chars is how many chars to show in each item description.
"Publish to" is possible places to put the content. You can choose custom post types if you have any.

Now reload the entry page and start working with your RSS-streams as news to your site/blog.
