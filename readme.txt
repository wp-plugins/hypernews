== Description ==

Editorial support, very fast user interface to manually select and publish RSS streams to your WordPress site/blog.

Add links to your WordPress Links and add them to a link category name.

Your Hypernews ui will now fetch and list your feeds. Keep track of which items is read and mark them as favorites or hide them. Or you can make a note on the item row.

If you want to edit them in Wordpress click on the post type links at each item row. The content will be saved as draft posts for later edit.

Note that this version just is a beta version and more will follow, like multi channel, search words, etc.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

In WordPress, add RSS-links into WordPress Links and then add them to a link category name.

Choose your settings in the Hypernews settings page.

Category name is the exact match to your link category name. 

Intervall is not used right now, coming soon.

Max Chars is how many chars to show in each item description.

"Publish to" is possible places to put the content. You can choose custom post types if you have any.

Now reload the entry page and start working with your RSS-streams as news to your site/blog.
