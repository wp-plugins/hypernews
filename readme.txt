== Description ==

Editorial support, very fast user interface to manually select and publish RSS streams to your WordPress site/blog.

Your Hypernews ui will now fetch and list your feeds. Keep track of which items is read and mark them as favorites or hide them. Or you can make a note on the item row.

If you want to edit them in Wordpress click on the post type links at each item row. The content will be saved as draft posts for later edit.

Note that this version just is a beta version and more will follow, like multi channel, search words, etc.

Hypernews is tested with/without network installation and seems to work fine.
